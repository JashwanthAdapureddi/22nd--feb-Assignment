Your task is to write a program that reads a text string from the user and determines which letters of the alphabet are not used in the string.
inputStr = input("Enter a text string: ")
text = inputStr.upper()

# TODO: define a set named notUsed that contains the letters of
# the alphabet that are not contained in the user entered string.
alphabets = ['A','B','C','D','E','F','G','H','I','J','K','L','M','N','O','P','Q','R','S','T','U','V','W','X','Y','Z']
for x in text:
   if x in alphabets:
      alphabets.remove(x)
notUsed = alphabets      
for element in sorted(notUsed) :
   print(element, end="")
print(),
